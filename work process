The first step is to declare the variables that will be used in the program. These variables include:
1. Header files and global variables: The code includes various header files, each providing different functionalities, such as standard input/output, file handling, etc. 
Global variables like f, s, addr, ad, flag, f1, d, m, i, amt, and tamt are declared at the beginning of the code. These variables will be used throughout the program.
2. Class Definitions: The code defines four classes: login, detail, reser, and canc, each login, detail, reser, and canc, each representing different aspects of the railway reservation system.
3. main() function: The main() function is the entry point of the program. It displays a menu for the user to choose between Admin mode, User mode, or exit the program. The user's choice is processed through a switch statement.
4. database() function: In this function, the administrator can create, add, and display train details. To access this mode, the user needs to enter the correct administrator password. 
The password is read from the user using the getpass() function, and if it matches the predefined password, the administrator can perform the required actions.
5. reserve() function: This function provides the user with an option to reserve a train ticket. The user can reserve tickets for multiple passengers, and the system calculates the fare based on the selected class and concession category.
6. res() function: This function is responsible for the actual reservation process. It reads the necessary details from the user, checks for available seats, calculates the fare, and generates a unique PNR (Passenger Name Record) for the reservation.
7. displaypassdetail() function: This function displays all the passenger details that have been reserved so far. It reads the data from the "p.txt" file and displays the details on the console.
8. enquiry() function: The enquiry() function displays all the available train details stored in the "t.txt" file.
9. cancell() function: This function allows the user to cancel a reserved ticket. It reads the PNR number from the user, searches for the corresponding reservation, and calculates the refund amount based on the cancellation rules.
10. can() function: This function provides the user with the option to perform the ticket cancellation process.
11. user() function: The user() function allows regular users to log in and access various functionalities like reservation, cancellation, and enquiry.
12. manage() function: This function is used for user management by the administrator. It allows the admin to create and add user IDs and passwords, as well as display the list of registered users.
13. Explanation: The code essentially implements a basic railway reservation system with two main modes: Admin mode and User mode. In Admin mode, the administrator can manage train details, user accounts, and view passenger.

Sure, let's break down the code step by step:
1.	Header files and global variables: The code includes various header files, each providing different functionalities, such as standard input/output, file handling, etc. Global variables like f, s, addr, ad, flag, f1, d, m, i, amt, and tamt are declared at the beginning of the code. These variables will be used throughout the program.
2.	Class Definitions: The code defines four classes: login, detail, reser, and canc, each representing different aspects of the railway reservation system.
3.	main() function: The main() function is the entry point of the program. It displays a menu for the user to choose between Admin mode, User mode, or exit the program. The user's choice is processed through a switch statement.
4.	database() function: In this function, the administrator can create, add, and display train details. To access this mode, the user needs to enter the correct administrator password. The password is read from the user using the getpass() function, and if it matches the predefined password, the administrator can perform the required actions.
5.	reserve() function: This function provides the user with an option to reserve a train ticket. The user can reserve tickets for multiple passengers, and the system calculates the fare based on the selected class and concession category.
6.	res() function: This function is responsible for the actual reservation process. It reads the necessary details from the user, checks for available seats, calculates the fare, and generates a unique PNR (Passenger Name Record) for the reservation.
7.	displaypassdetail() function: This function displays all the passenger details that have been reserved so far. It reads the data from the "p.txt" file and displays the details on the console.
8.	enquiry() function: The enquiry() function displays all the available train details stored in the "t.txt" file.
9.	cancell() function: This function allows the user to cancel a reserved ticket. It reads the PNR number from the user, searches for the corresponding reservation, and calculates the refund amount based on the cancellation rules.
10.	can() function: This function provides the user with the option to perform the ticket cancellation process.
11.	user() function: The user() function allows regular users to log in and access various functionalities like reservation, cancellation, and enquiry.
12.	manage() function: This function is used for user management by the administrator. It allows the admin to create and add user IDs and passwords, as well as display the list of registered users.
13.	Explanation: The code essentially implements a basic railway reservation system with two main modes: Admin mode and User mode. In Admin mode, the administrator can manage train details, user accounts, and view passenger information. In User mode, regular users can perform tasks like reserving tickets, cancelling tickets, and checking train details.
Please note that the code seems to be written for an older C++ compiler that uses header files like conio.h and iostream.h, which are not standard in modern C++ and might not be supported in some newer compilers. It's recommended to use more standard C++ headers like <iostream> and <fstream>. Also, some parts of the code could be improved for better readability and maintainability.
